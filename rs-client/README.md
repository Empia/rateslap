About

RateSlap client is a simple http-client for interacting with RateSlap Web Service.

Both service and client based on JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol and every protocol-related wrapping/unwrapping is encapsulated inside client's jar. Client contains one public Java class to interact with. It is well-documented and pretty simple. Under the hood client uses Scala and implements some Java-to-Scala type conversion to make it easy-to-use in Java applications.
